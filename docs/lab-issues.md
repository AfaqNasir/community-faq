# Lab Issues

You're probably reading this because you've experienced labs that are crashing, not loading, slow or other similar reasons.

We are really sorry that you are experiencing this, however you must understand a few things. If you are successful in fulfilling a career in DevOps, these sorts of issues will become very familiar to you and is all in the day in the life of a DevOps engineer!

First off, let's rule out any potential browser issues. If you are new to the labs, this could be the issue. Please read and try out the tips here: https://support.kodekloud.com/troubleshooting-labs

If the labs are still not working, there are a number of reasons this may be happening. To provide the labs, we rely on Cloud-based infrastructure and various other third party services, such as content distribution network (CDN) providers and the like which are not under our control. Any of these pieces in the puzzle could be having an issue, meaning that if it is not something under our control, we all have to wait until the third party fixes their issue.

Additionally, we have tens of thousands of students doing courses at any one time. There is only so much infrastructure to go round. It may be that you've hit a busy time, so you should wait a few minutes and retry. If still broken, wait a few hours before retrying. Even Cloud providers (which we rely on) have periods where infrastructure cannot be provisioned due to excessive demand.

Occasionally the issue is within KodeKloud itself. When this is the case or if we know where the cause is, there will generally be announcements made on our [Lab Support Slack channel](https://kodekloud.slack.com/archives/C045CAW4PJP), so you should also check there for updates and fix ETAs

The key takeaway from this is that the issues you may be facing are not always something that is our fault, therefore not something that can be fixed immediately.

We thank you for your patience.
