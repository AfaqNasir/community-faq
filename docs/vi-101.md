# vi-101

Real simple guide to the most important stuff with `vi` editor and questions commonly asked

# I cannot exit vi

A number of possibilities.

1. You are not in `normal` mode.

    You need to be in `normal` mode to execute any of the commands to exit the editor.
    If it says `INSERT`, `VISUAL` or anything like that at the bottom of the screen, press `ESC` until it no longer does.

    Then you should be able to press `:` and see it come up at the bottom of the screen, so you're able to enter something like `wq`

1. You are editing a read-only file.

    You get a message like `E505 "file" is read only (add ! to override)` when you try `:wq`.

    The message is ecouraging you to do `:wq!` to force overwrite of a read-only file, but if that file belongs to root and you are not root, then this isn't going to work and you'll get the same error. The only way to exit in this case is to exit *without* saving, which is `:q!`. For root owned files, you must use `sudo`, e.g.

    ```
    sudo vi /etc/hosts
    ```
# Most useful normal mode commands

All the following work in `normal` mode. As soon as you enter insert mode, you need to press `ESC` before any of the following will work again.

## Files

* Saving without exiting

    * `:w` - When editing YAML do this, and run `kubectl apply` in another terminal window. Saves you going in and out the editor if you have syntax errors. Only quit `vi` once `kubectl` is successful.

* Exit without saving

    * `:q!`

* Exit and save

    1. `:wq`
    1. `:x`

* Pasting from documentation

    * `:set paste` - Turn on paste mode. Then hit `i` for insert mode. It will say `INSERT (paste)`
    * `:set nopaste` - Turn off paste mode. Do this immediately after pasting from documentation.

## Editing

* `i` - Enter insert mode at cursor position
* `SHIFT - A` - Enter insert mode at end of current line
* `dd` - Delete line under cursor. (`2dd` next 2 lines, `5dd` next 5 lines etc.)
* `u` - Undo last edit (`2u` last 2 edits etc.)
* `SHIFT + D` - Delete from cursor to end of line
* `y` - Yank (copy) current line to vi internal buffer (not desktop clipboard)
* `p` - Paste from vi internal buffer
* `SHIFT + G` - Go to last line in file
